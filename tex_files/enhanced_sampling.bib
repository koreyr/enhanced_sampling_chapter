The effectiveness of the method for the protein-folding problem is tested with the penta-peptide Met-enkephalin. The method can overcome the multiple-minima problem by exchanging non-interacting replicas of the system at several temperatures. From only one simulation run, one can obtain probability distributions in canonical ensemble for a wide temperature range using multiple-histogram reweighting techniques, which allows the calculation of any thermodynamic quantity as a function of temperature in that range. q},

   abstract = {A recognized shortcoming in current protein simulations is that most force fields are parametrized with relatively primitive three-site water models. Since the deficiencies of the common three-site water models in reproducing the phase diagram of water are well-known, an improved description of the solvent will be required, for example, to study proteins in molecular simulations at thermodynamic conditions other than standard temperature and pressure. Here, we combine a protein force field derived from Amber ff03 together with the highly optimized TIP4P/2005 water model, with a small backbone modification to match the population of helical states obtained with the new water model to experiment. Remarkably, we find that the resulting force field, Amber ff03w, produces a more cooperative helix-coil transition, compared with the similarly "backbone-corrected" Amber ff03* model with TIP3P water, with calculated helix propagation parameters in good agreement with the experiment. The radius of gyration for nonhelical conformations is significantly larger for Amber ff03w than for Amber ff03* and shows a collapse with increasing temperature as found in single-molecule experiments on longer proteins. The origin of the collapse appears to be a more favorable enthalpic component of the peptide-solvent interaction and is correlated with increasing turn formation, in accord with the experiment. In addition to this enhanced cooperativity, we verify that, with the new force field, replica exchange folding simulations of the GB1 hairpin and Trp cage result in folded structures, starting from completely unfolded initial conditions; simulations of folded proteins are also stable. These results together suggest that Amber ff03w (with TIP4P/2005) will be well suited for studying protein folding and properties of unfolded state and intrinsically disordered proteins over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions.},

We discuss the algorithms that are used to exploit the processing power of the GPUs and show the performance that can be achieved in comparison to simulations on conventional CPU clusters. The implementation supports three different precision models in which the contributions to the forces are calculated in single precision floating point arithmetic but accumulated in double precision (SPDP), or everything is computed in single precision (SPSP) or double precision (DPDP). In addition to performance, we have focused on understanding the implications of the different precision models on the outcome of implicit solvent MD simulations. We show results for a range of tests including the accuracy of single point force evaluations and energy conservation as well as structural properties pertainining to protein dynamics. The numerical noise due to rounding errors within the SPSP precision model is sufficiently large to lead to an accumulation of errors which can result in unphysical trajectories for long time scale simulations. We recommend the use of the mixed-precision SPDP model since the numerical results obtained are comparable with those of the full double precision DPDP model and the reference double precision CPU implementation but at significantly reduced computational cost. Our implementation provides performance for GB simulations on a single desktop that is on par with, and in some cases exceeds, that of traditional supercomputers. © 2012 American Chemical Society.},

In this way, it differs significantly from other biomolecular force fields. Further development and testing of the intermolecular potentials are presented here. Subsequently, rotational potentials for the φ/ψ and χ dihedral degrees of freedom are obtained by analysis of the Protein Data Bank, followed by small modifications to provide a reasonable balance between simulated and observed α and β percentages for small peptides.

It has been unclear, however, whether any physical model (force field) used in MD simulations accurately describes both folded and disordered proteins. Here, we select a benchmark set of 21 systems, including folded and disordered proteins, simulate these systems with six state-of-the-art force fields, and compare the results to over 9,000 available experimental data points. We find that none of the tested force fields simultaneously provided accurate descriptions of folded proteins, of the dimensions of disordered proteins, and of the secondary structure propensities of disordered proteins. Guided by simulation results on a subset of our benchmark, however, we modified parameters of one force field, achieving excellent agreement with experiment for disordered proteins, while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for folded proteins. The resulting force field, a99SB-disp, should thus greatly expand the range of biological systems amenable to MD simulation. A similar approach could be taken to improve other force fields.},

These chemical environments are probed by focusing on the hydration properties of two molecules: N-methylacetamide and phenyl bromide. Both, equilibrium and dynamical, quantities are affected by the quality of the electrostatic model. The alteration of the first solvation shell in MTP simulations is validated by comparing with lifetimes and correlation times of solute−solvent interactions from experiment.

   abstract = {The accuracy of atomistic physics-based force fields for the simulation of biological macromolecules has typically been benchmarked experimentally using biophysical data from simple, often single-chain systems. In the case of proteins, the careful refinement of force field parameters associated with torsion-angle potentials and the use of improved water models have enabled a great deal of progress toward the highly accurate simulation of such monomeric systems in both folded and, more recently, disordered states. In living organisms, however, proteins constantly interact with other macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, and these interactions are often essential for proper biological function. Here, we show that state-of-the-art force fields tuned to provide an accurate description of both ordered and disordered proteins can be limited in their ability to accurately describe protein-protein complexes. This observation prompted us to perform an extensive reparameterization of one variant of the Amber protein force field. Our objective involved refitting not only the parameters associated with torsion-angle potentials but also the parameters used to model nonbonded interactions, the specification of which is expected to be central to the accurate description of multicomponent systems. The resulting force field, which we call DES-Amber, allows for more accurate simulations of protein-protein complexes, while still providing a state-of-the-art description of both ordered and disordered single-chain proteins. Despite the improvements, calculated protein-protein association free energies still appear to deviate substantially from experiment, a result suggesting that more fundamental changes to the force field, such as the explicit treatment of polarization effects, may simultaneously further improve the modeling of single-chain proteins and protein-protein complexes.},

This effective two-body force field is the successor to the Weiner et al. force field and was developed with some of the same philosophies, such as the use of a simple diagonal potential function and electrostatic potential fit atom centered charges. The need for a 10-12 function for representing hydrogen bonds is no longer necessary due to the improved performance of the new charge model and new van der Waals parameters. These new charges are determined using a 6-31G* basis set and restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fitting and have been shown to reproduce interaction energies, free energies of solvation, and conformational energies of simple small molecules to a good degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the new RESP charges exhibit less variability as a function of the molecular conformation used in the charge determination. The new van der Waals parameters have been derived from liquid simulations and include hydrogen parameters which take into account the effects of any geminal electronegative atoms. The bonded parameters developed by Weiner et al. were modified as necessary to reproduce experimental vibrational frequencies and structures. Most of the simple dihedral parameters have been retained from Weiner et al., but a complex set of 4 and yj parameters which do a good job of reproducing the energies of the low-energy conformations of glycyl and alanyl dipeptides has been developed for the peptide backbone.},

By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation.

Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

   abstract = {Anton 2 is a second-generation special-purpose supercomputer for molecular dynamics simulations that achieves significant gains in performance, programmability, and capacity compared to its predecessor, Anton 1. The architecture of Anton 2 is tailored for fine-grained event-driven operation, which improves performance by increasing the overlap of computation with communication, and also allows a wider range of algorithms to run efficiently, enabling many new software-based optimizations. A 512-node Anton 2 machine, currently in operation, is up to ten times faster than Anton 1 with the same number of nodes, greatly expanding the reach of all-atom bio molecular simulations. Anton 2 is the first platform to achieve simulation rates of multiple microseconds of physical time per day for systems with millions of atoms. Demonstrating strong scaling, the machine simulates a standard 23,558-atom benchmark system at a rate of 85 μs/day - 180 times faster than any commodity hardware platform or general-purpose supercomputer.},

   abstract = {In a recently developed multiscale enhanced sampling (MSES) technique, topology‐based coarse‐grained (CG) models are coupled to atomistic force fields to enhance the sampling of atomistic protein conformations. Here, the MSES protocol is refined by designing more sophisticated Hamiltonian/temperature replica exchange schemes that involve additional parameters in the MSES coupling restraint potential, to more carefully control how conformations are coupled between the atomistic and CG models. A specific focus is to derive an optimal MSES protocol for simulating conformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). The efficacy of the refined protocols, referred to as MSES‐soft asymptote (SA), was evaluated using two model peptides with various levels of residual helicities. The results show that MSES‐SA generates more reversible helix‐coil transitions and leads to improved convergence on various ensemble conformational properties. This study further suggests that more detailed CG models are likely necessary for more effective sampling of local conformational transition of IDPs. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   abstract = {A small change in the Hamiltonian scaling in Replica Exchange with Solute Tempering (REST) is found to improve its sampling efficiency greatly, especially for the sampling of aqueous protein solutions in which there are large-scale solute conformation changes. Like the original REST (REST1), the new version (which we call REST2) also bypasses the poor scaling with system size of the standard Temperature Replica Exchange Method (TREM), reducing the number of replicas (parallel processes) from what must be used in TREM. This reduction is accomplished by deforming the Hamiltonian function for each replica in such a way that the acceptance probability for the exchange of replica configurations does not depend on the number of explicit water molecules in the system. For proof of concept, REST2 is compared with TREM and with REST1 for the folding of the trpcage and β-hairpin in water. The comparisons confirm that REST2 greatly reduces the number of CPUs required by regular replica exchange and greatly increases the sampling efficiency over REST1. This method reduces the CPU time required for calculating thermodynamic averages and for the ab initio folding of proteins in explicit water. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

   abstract = {Protein aggregation is associated with many human diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and type II diabetes (T2D). Understanding the molecular mechanism of protein aggregation is essential for therapy development. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been shown as powerful tools to study protein aggregation. However, conventional MD simulations can hardly sample the whole conformational space of complex protein systems within acceptable simulation time as it can be easily trapped in local minimum-energy states. Many enhanced sampling methods have been developed. Among these, the replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) method has gained great popularity. By combining MD simulation with the Monte Carlo algorithm, the REMD method is capable of overcoming high energy-barriers easily and of sampling sufficiently the conformational space of proteins. In this chapter, we present a brief introduction to REMD method and a practical application protocol with a case study of the dimerization of the 11-25 fragment of human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP(11-25)), using the GROMACS software. We also provide solutions to problems that are often encountered in practical use, and provide some useful scripts/commands from our research that can be easily adapted to other systems.},

Available methodologies for sampling conformational equilibria and associations of biomacromolecules in the canonical ensemble, given a continuum description of the solvent environment, are reviewed. Detailed sections are provided dealing with the choice of degrees of freedom, the efficiencies of MC algorithms and algorithmic peculiarities, as well as the optimization of simple movesets. The issue of introducing correlations into elementary MC moves and the applicability of such methods to simulations of biomacromolecules are discussed. A brief discussion of multicanonical methods and an overview of recent simulation work highlighting the potential of MC methods are also provided. It is argued that MC simulations, although underutilized in the biomacromolecular simulation community, hold promise for simulations of complex systems and phenomena that span multiple length scales, especially when used in conjunction with implicit solvation models or other coarse-graining strategies. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Zhang2023,
   abstract = {Replica exchange with solute tempering (REST) is a highly effective variant of replica exchange for enhanced sampling in explicit solvent simulations of biomolecules. By scaling the Hamiltonian for a selected "solute" region of the system, REST effectively applies tempering only to the degrees of freedom of interest but not the rest of the system ("solvent"), allowing fewer replicas for covering the same temperature range. A key consideration of REST is how the solute−solvent interactions are scaled together with the solute−solute interactions. Here, we critically evaluate the performance of the latest REST2 protocol for sampling large-scale conformation fluctuations of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). The results show that REST2 promotes artificial protein conformational collapse at high effective temperatures, which seems to be a designed feature originally to promote the sampling of reversible folding of small proteins. The collapse is particularly severe with larger IDPs, leading to replica segregation in the effective temperature space and hindering effective sampling of large-scale conformational changes. We propose that the scaling of the solute−solvent interactions can be treated as free parameters in REST, which can be tuned to control the solute conformational properties (e.g., chain expansion) at different effective temperatures and achieve more effective sampling. To this end, we derive a new REST3 protocol, where the strengths of the solute−solvent van der Waals interactions are recalibrated to reproduce the levels of protein chain expansion at high effective temperatures. The efficiency of REST3 is examined using two IDPs with nontrivial local and long-range structural features, including the p53 N-terminal domain and the kinase inducible transactivation domain of transcription factor CREB. The results suggest that REST3 leads to a much more efficient temperature random walk and improved sampling efficiency, which also further reduces the number of replicas required. Nonetheless, our analysis also reveals significant challenges of relying on tempering alone for sampling large-scale conformational fluctuations of disordered proteins. It is likely that more efficient sampling protocols will require incorporating more sophisticated Hamiltonian replica exchange schemes in addition to tempering.},

   abstract = {Metadynamics is a popular enhanced sampling algorithm for computing the free energy landscape of rare events by using molecular dynamics simulation. Ten years ago, Tiwary and Parrinello introduced the infrequent metadynamics approach for calculating the kinetics of transitions across free energy barriers. Since then, metadynamics-based methods for obtaining rate constants have attracted significant attention in computational molecular science. Such methods have been applied to study a wide range of problems, including protein-ligand binding, protein folding, conformational transitions, chemical reactions, catalysis, and nucleation. Here, we review the principles of elucidating kinetics from metadynamics-like approaches, subsequent methodological developments in this area, and successful applications on chemical, biological, and material systems. We also highlight the challenges of reconstructing accurate kinetics from enhanced sampling simulations and the scope of future developments.},

Recently, a variation of metadynamics (MetaD) named parallel bias metadynamics (PBMetaD) has been shown to make biasing of many CVs more tractable. We extended the PBMetaD scheme so that it partitions degenerate CVs into families that share the same bias potential, consequently expediting convergence of the free-energy landscape. We tested our method, named parallel bias metadynamics with partitioned families, on 3, 21, and 78 CV systems and obtained an approximately proportional increase in convergence speed compared to standard PBMetaD.},
