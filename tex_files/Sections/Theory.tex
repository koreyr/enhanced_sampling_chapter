From Replica Exchange Molecular Dynamics\cite{Sugita1999}, the hamiltonian representing the potential energy of the system can be written as sum of respective contributions, separated into protein-protein, protein-water and water-water:
\input{equations/remd_hamiltonian.tex}
$\lambda_{n}^M$ is the scaling factor, where $M=\{ pp, pw, ww\}
$ which scales the corresponding energy term. For REST2\cite{Wang2011}, $\lambda_n^{ww}=1$, $\lambda_n^{pp}=(\lambda_n^{pw})^2=\lambda_n$, for simplicity the REST2 hamiltonian simplifies to:

Upon investigation, disordered proteins containing hydrophobic residues undergo conformational collapse with respect to scaling  $E^{pw}$ to higher effective temperatures. This outcome is unfavorable when attempting to capture a representative ensemble as hydrophobic collapse reduces the overall sampling of the proteins degrees of freedom. % We need to say something here to the effect: REST2's ability to enhance hydrophobic interactions is synonamous with reducing the quality of the solvent, water. 
\citeauthor{Zhang2023} \citeyear{Zhang2023} provided a basis for biasing the scaling such that protein collapse is minimized or negated. The formalism they proposed,

By incorporating the scaling factor $\kappa_n$, where $n=\{1,2,3,\ldots,n_{replica}\}$, the dampening effect of $\lambda$ is deminished. To accomplish this $\kappa_n$ exist in the range $[1.0,1.1]$. Due to the method of implementation the base replica (unscaled topology), following conversion of the topologies to REST3 \cite{Zhang2023} formalism using combination rule 1 instead of 2, does not match the potential energy of the original topology. The implementation of REST3 by \citeauthor{Zhang2023} targeted scaling of protein water atoms, this led to inception of ssREST3 where $\lambda_n$ is still applied to the protein in the same fashion as REST2 \cite{Wang2011} and apply solvent scaling on the water oxygen borrowing from the methods described in \citeauthor{Best2010} \citeyear{Best2010}. $\kappa_n$ is defined by the expression,
