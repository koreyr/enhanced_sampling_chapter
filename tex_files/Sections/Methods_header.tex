Now that we have a base understanding of Replica Exchange Methods it is high time to apply this new found knowledge. 
This example focuses on the application of REST2 on $\alpha$-synuclein in a solvated water box.
In the first part we will generate starting structures. In the second part, follwing generating the independent systems from our assortment of starting structures, each will be equilibrated, one for each replica. 
In the third part, from each equilibrated system the final configuration will carry forward and the paired topology will be scaled by $\lambda_n$ as described in Section \ref{sec:Intro-RE}, Eq. \ref{eq:lambda_scaling}. In the fourth part, simulations will be caried out with simple instructions to check if the systems are exchanging appropriately and a show of exchange convergence w.r.t. round trip times. In the last part, we will carry out an analysis on the resulting trajectory, which will include de-multiplexing of the temperature replica and convergence analysis.
