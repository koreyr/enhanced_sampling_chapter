Now that we have a base understanding of Replica Exchange Methods it is high time to apply this new found knowledge. 
This example focuses on the application of REST2 on $\alpha$-synuclein in a solvated water box.
In the first part we will equilibrate each system from a random assortment of conformations, one for each replica. 
In the second part, from equilibrated system will take their final configuration and scale the paired topology by $\lambda_n$ as described in Section \ref{sec:Intro}, Eq. \ref{eq:lambda_scaling}. In the third part, simulations will be caried out with simple instructions to check if the systems are exchanging appropriately. In the last part, we will carry out an analysis on the resulting trajectory, which will include de-multiplexing of the temperature replica and convergence analysis.
