For any simulations initial positions of the particles are very important.
PDB files provides us with the required information about the initial coordinates where each atom is represented as a particle in space.
It might get one wondering on how can a bunch of particles arranged in a 3-dimentional space can behave as a protein or a small molecule.
This is be achieved with the help of force-field parameters which are a set of basic parameters that governs the interaction potentials between the different atoms of the molecule or protein.
These force-field parameters are derived and optimized from quantum mechanical calculations and experimental data which helps us in replicating the macroscopic observables.
