Accurate simulations of intrinsically disordered proteins and peptides provides predictive power and insight into experimental findings extending our predictive capabilities in molecular interactions and understanding biological mechanisms. Unlike equilibrium simulations of ordered proteins in their ground state, simulating disordered proteins, as well as rare allosteric effects in structured proteins, require long continuous simulations which may not be well sampled even out to 1 ms. Replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations with solvent scaling proves to be a powerful group of methods to sample dynamics with limited resources. REST2 and ssREST3 show promise in accelerating the sampling of
