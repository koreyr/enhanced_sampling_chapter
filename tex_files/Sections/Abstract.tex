Accurate simulations of intrinsically disordered proteins and peptides  predictive power and insight into experimental findings extending our predictive capabilities in molecular interactions and understanding biological mechanisms. 
Unlike equilibrium simulations of ordered proteins in their ground state, simulating disordered proteins, as well as rare allosteric effects in structured proteins, require long continuous simulations which may not be well sampled even out to 1 ms. 
Replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations with solvent scaling proves to be a powerful group of methods to sample dynamics with limited resources. 
REST2 and ssREST3 are promising methods in accelerating the sampling of the conformational ensemble, not ommiting the caveat: the simulation is only as good as the forcefield. 
In addition to discussing the background, we provide an example of REST2 and ssREST3 as it pertains to simulating the C-terminal domain of $\alpha$-synuclein with and without a small molecular ligand and with an emphasis on assessing convergence of desired collective variables or observables.
