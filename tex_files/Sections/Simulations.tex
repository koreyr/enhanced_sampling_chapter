To observe if the REST3 is preventing the collapse in the conformations of an IDP we use $\alpha$-synuclein in absence and presence of a ligand "Fasudil".
The protein is solvated using tip4p-\textit{disp} 4 point water model and sufficient amount of ions are added to netralize the system.
The system is minimized up to 50000 steps using steepest decent algorithm and then system has undergone a reguras equlibration.
Once the solvated replicas are well equlibrated, the replicates are simulated under NVT ensemble for 1$\mu$s totaling an aggregate of 16$\mu$s.
