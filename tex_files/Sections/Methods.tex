Implementing the ssREST3 in molecular dynamics simulations requires the use of the PLUMED2.8 plugin for GROMACS version 2023.5. 
The first step in the ssREST3 implementation is to generate the topology files your protein of interest which is solvated in a box. 
This topology files will be used as to implement REST2 scaling procedure using PLUMED2.8. 
After the topology files are generated for the respective replicates the heavy atoms of the solvent, for example OW$_{tip4p}$ which is the water oxygen atom of amber99sb-\textit{disp} force field whose $\epsilon$ will be scaled by a factor of $\kappa^{2}_{n}$ to satisfy the scaling condition as mentioned in Eq. \ref{eq:epsilon_scaling}, \ref{eq:wat_scaling}. 
If $\kappa_{n}$ is set to 1.0 across all replicas on can observe the it behaves like a conventional REST2. 
Along with the scaling of the water oxygen we also made sure that the self interaction of the solvent molecules and there interactions with the ions will no tbe effected by adding 3 additions lines in the \textit{[nonbonded]} section of the GROMACS topology file as shown in \ref{tab:eps_noscale_table}.
Once this changes are made to the topology files we are ready to run the simulations.
The conformational exchange between the replicas is set for every 800 steps which equates to 1.6 ps.
